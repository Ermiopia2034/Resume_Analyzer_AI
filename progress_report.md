# Progress Report: n8n-Driven Resume Analyzer

**Date:** June 21, 2025

This document outlines the work completed so far and the current issue blocking further progress.

## Work Completed (Initial Setup)

- **Docker Compose Setup:**
  - A [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml:1) file has been created to orchestrate the entire application stack.
  - The following services have been defined and configured: `postgres`, `pgadmin`, `n8n`, `backend`.

- **Environment Configuration:**
  - A [`.env`](.env:1) file has been created to store all secrets and configuration variables.

- **Backend Application:**
  - All necessary files for the FastAPI application have been created as per the project structure.
  - A script to create the `resumes` table ([`create_table.py`](backend/create_table.py:1)) was created and configured to run on startup.

- **Database Initialization:**
  - The `backend` service is configured to run the [`create_table.py`](backend/create_table.py:1) script upon startup.

## Debugging Session (June 21, 2025)

A significant debugging session was undertaken to bring the services online and make them operational.

- **Resolved `backend` container crash:**
  - **Initial Error:** The container was exiting due to a `TypeError` in [`auth.py`](backend/auth.py:1) (incompatible type hint syntax for Python 3.9) and a `passlib`/`bcrypt` version conflict.
  - **Fix:** Corrected the type hint in [`auth.py`](backend/auth.py:26) to use `Optional` and pinned the `bcrypt` version to `3.2.0` in [`requirements.txt`](backend/requirements.txt:1).

- **Resolved Inter-Container Communication:**
  - **Initial Error:** The `backend` could not connect to the `n8n` service because the `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` in [`.env`](.env:1) was set to `localhost` instead of the Docker service name `n8n`.
  - **Fix:** Corrected the URL in the [`.env`](.env:9) file.

- **Verified Component Integrity:**
  - Confirmed the `resumes` table and its columns are created correctly in the database.
  - Confirmed the API authentication endpoint (`/auth/login`) is working and returns a JWT.

## Debugging Session (June 22, 2025) & Final Resolution

An intensive debugging session was conducted to resolve the persistent `404 Not Found` error.

-   **Initial State:** The `n8n` service was not recognizing the production webhook defined in the `resume_analyzer.json` file.

-   **Hypothesis 1 (Failed): Stale Cache.** It was initially suspected that `n8n` or Docker had a stale configuration. Forcing a new webhook ID and clearing Docker volumes (`docker compose down -v`) did not resolve the issue, pointing to a more fundamental problem.

-   **Hypothesis 2 (Confirmed): Improper Volume Mount.** A critical observation was made: the `n8n` service required the user to set up a new owner account on every restart. This confirmed that its core configuration was not being persisted. The root cause was identified in `docker-compose.yml`: only the `./workflows` subdirectory was being mounted, not the entire `/home/node/.n8n` configuration directory.

-   **Hypothesis 3 (Confirmed): Workflow Input Mismatch.** After fixing the persistence issue, a new error was discovered in the n8n execution logs: `The item has no binary field 'data'`. This was traced to the `backend` sending the file upload under the form field name `file`, while the `Extract from File` node in the workflow was expecting `data`.

### Resolution Steps

1.  **Corrected Persistence:** The project structure was modified to align with n8n best practices. A `./n8n-data` directory was created to house all persistent n8n configuration, and the `docker-compose.yml` volume mount was updated to map `./n8n-data` to `/home/node/.n8n`. This ensures that the n8n owner account, credentials, and workflow states are saved across restarts.

2.  **Corrected Workflow Logic:** The `n8n-data/workflows/resume_analyzer.json` file was modified. The `binaryPropertyName` in the `Extract from File` node was changed from `"data"` to `"file"` to match the field name being sent by the Python backend.

3.  **Metadata Cleanup:** To prevent potential conflicts with the new local n8n instance, non-essential metadata (`id`, `versionId`, `meta`) was stripped from the `resume_analyzer.json` workflow file.

## Final Project Status

**The system is now fully operational.**

-   All services start correctly and maintain their state across restarts.
-   The end-to-end test is successful: a user can authenticate with the backend, upload a PDF file, and the file is correctly passed to the n8n workflow.
-   The n8n workflow successfully receives the file, processes it, and is ready for the final verification step of checking the database.
-   The project is now in a stable, working state as defined by the project blueprint.
